# morningstar-exercise
## This project uses Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind CSS
## To get started, 
1. navigate to /Morningstar-search-autocomplete-paulogonzales
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run dev`
4. go to `http://localhost:5173/`
## That should hopefully be it. You will also need to run the server.js in the directory above it. 
### Regarding the provided code, I had to make a quick modification to server.js by adding 'cors'.
